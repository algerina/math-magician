# Math-Magician
"Math magician" is a website for all fans of mathematics. It is a Single Page App (SPA) that allows users to:
Make simple calculations.
Read a random math-related quote.

## Built With
- React
- Visual Studio Code


## Getting Started


### To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
Web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Setup
Go to the top of the page, press te green button that says "Code", and copy the link. Then you have to go to your console and type

Git clone https://github.com/algerina/math-magician.git

That's all, you are ready to go!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.


### Run tests

Javascript linters

```
    npx eslint .
```

HTML linters

```
    npx hint .

```

CSS linters

```
    npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}"
